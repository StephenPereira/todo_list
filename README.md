# todo_list
My To-Do List Website, built using HTML, CSS & JS (ES6)

## General information
The To-Do list is currently a work in progress. It should function well in all browsers, and has basic functionality. The list uses a combination of event listeners and DOM events to trigger functions and add items to the list.
Hover effects are added for better visability, and all fields and buttons can be accessed using a keyboard. Labels are
added so text-to-speech software works well, and fonts are clear so those with vision difficulties can easily read items. All contents of the list are stored in a map, which is used to update local storage and keep track of contents. 

### Version 1.0
The To-Do list has been given a minor design update to make it more accessible and less grey. The list now mirrors the look of a card or paper, giving it a familiar look. All the list items and title are stored in a map, which is then used to update local storage. 

### Currently being worked on:
The next steps are to clean up the code and seperate the javaScript into components instead of having all in one file. Eventually it will be packaged using Node.js and NPM and bundled with Webpack. Eventually React will be implemented as well.
