# todo_list
My To-do List Website, built using HTML, CSS & JS (ES6)

## General information
The To-do list is currently a work in progress. It should function well in browsers, and has basic functionality. It
currently does not have any local storage or persistance, so on page refresh the contents will reset (This is currently
being added). The list uses a combination of event listeners and DOM events to trigger functions and add items to the list.
Hover effects are added for better visability, and all fields and buttons can be accessed using a keyboard. Labels are
added so text-to-speech software works well, and fonts are clear so those with vision difficulties can easily read items. 

### Currently being worked on:
Once local storage is implemented, the next steps are to clean up the code and seperate the javaScript into components
instead of having all in one file. Eventually it will be packaged using Node.js and NPM and bundled with Webpack.
Eventually React will be implemented as well.
